# Sign-Language-Recognizer
This project translates Indian sign language gestures into text in real-time. By utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed for sequence prediction, the system will accurately process and interpret the dynamic sequences of sign language gestures.
